# Microsoft-Azure-Sentinel-SIEM

## What is Microsoft Sentinel?
Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution developed by Microsoft. Microsoft Sentinel enables organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats in real time while providing better visibility into their environments, enhanced threat detection capabilities, and a streamlined response mechanism to address emerging challenges, all leveraging the scalability and flexibility of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.
Key features of Microsoft Sentinel include:
- Data Collection at Scale: Sentinel collects and analyzes security data from a wide variety of sources, such as servers, applications, firewalls, and endpoint devices. It integrates natively with Microsoft 365 Defender, Azure services, and third-party tools through built-in connectors.
- Threat Detection with Advanced AI: Sentinel uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect known and unknown threats, reducing the number of false positives and helping security teams focus on high-priority incidents.
- Interactive Investigation Tools: Analysts can use intuitive dashboards, graphical attack maps, and interactive queries (via KQL, or Kusto Query Language) to investigate security incidents and visualize attack paths.
- Automation and Playbooks: With built-in automation, Sentinel helps streamline responses to incidents by triggering automated workflows, known as playbooks, to contain and mitigate threats efficiently.
- Scalable and Cost-Effective: As a cloud-native solution, Sentinel eliminates the need for managing on-premises infrastructure. Organizations pay only for the data ingested, which makes it cost-effective and easily scalable as security needs grow.
