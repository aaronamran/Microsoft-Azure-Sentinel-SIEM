# Microsoft-Azure-Sentinel-SIEM

## What is Microsoft Sentinel?
Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution by Microsoft, designed to help organizations detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats in real time. It provides enhanced visibility, AI-driven threat detection, intuitive investigation tools like dashboards and attack maps, and automated response workflows through playbooks. Leveraging Azure's scalability and flexibility, Microsoft Sentinel enables cost-effective, scalable data collection from various sources and streamlines threat detection and response processes.

## Practical Lab Objective
The goal of this lab is to deploy a vulnerable Azure Virtual Machine (Honeypot) exposed to the internet to capture and log live cyber-attacks. The data collected from various IP addresses worldwide will be monitored and used to create a real-time attack map, visually displaying the geographic origins of these attacks on a world map.
